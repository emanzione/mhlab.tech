#### Who am I?
My name is Emanuele and I am a software engineer! I have a deep passion for computers, programming, engineering challenges and for games. 

#### What do I do?
I develop games and tools to support games development. I love all games genres, but my favorites are multiplayer games, MMOGs and the engineering challenge they represent. That's why I chose to start working on networking and backend services.

#### Why a blog?
Just to share knowledge and to log my journey about self-improvement! Here you will find rants about what I am working on, general thoughts about technologies I am studying, tutorials and so on... And if you like what I do, buy me a coffee:
